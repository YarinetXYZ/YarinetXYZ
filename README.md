# Hello, I'm Yarinet 
## About Me:
After experiencing relatives fall victim to significant financial cybercrimes firsthand, I was driven to protect others from similar threats. This pivotal event ignited my passion for cybersecurity, and now, with a solid foundation and hands-on skills, I am committed to defending systems and individuals against emerging threats as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst.

## Objecives:
- I’m currently working on projects to enhance my skills as a SOC Analyst, focusing on threat detection and incident response.
- Two years of experience as a Level 2 IT Support Technician, I’m aiming to transition into a cybersecurity career. 
- Researching emerging cyber threats and penetration testing methodologies to improve proactive defense strategies.
- Building expertise in endpoint security and access management to strengthen organizational defenses.
- Experimenting with SIEM tools and threat intelligence platforms to gain real-world security operations experience.
